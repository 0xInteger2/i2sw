            <h3>Assertion:</h3>
            <p>
              When someone creates open source software, it comes from the place
              of believing what they've created is so valuable the public must
              have the right to study and modify it. If the creators are
              honorable they allow others to monetize it as well. If the
              creators are smart they'd force any software built on top of their
              software to also be open source so the originator can in return
              benefit. DLTs are one of those things.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              All teams working on DLTs are of the mind that if banking is now
              digital, and we all have computers, We the People should liberate
              ourselves from the Central Banking System to varying degrees by
              running open source money platforms where ever we can. In doing so
              we offload some infrastructure and overhead from banks and payment
              processors. See
              <a href="" target="_blank">my article on DLTs</a> for how.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>Premise (V3):</h3>
            <p>
              All transactions modify account values in a ledger. DLTs are open
              source, openly distributed, immutable ledgers maintained by
              participants in a network. DLT Network participants are
              compensated with the ability to transact on the ledger further
              (money). The EVM is a DLT with the added functionality of creating
              "contracts", which are opt-in and open source (audit-able)
              software agreements that modify the flow of the ledgers money.
              These "contracts" or open source money software agreements are
              widely known as Smart Contracts.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              In the shortest terms, the primary and first implementation of the
              EVM, the Ethereum network, is a freely available and
              internationally hosted money platform with an immutable
              transaction history for any agreement which can be written into
              software.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              All digital products will be offered on Smart Contract Capable
              DLTs as they are transparent and therefore perfectly efficient
              markets.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              So far we have addressed DLTs, which are openly distributed
              ledgers that pay network participants in their local money, and
              the EVM which is a DLT that allows for Smart Contracts to modify
              the flow of that money. If you have a platform with money, and
              agreements, you can do business. Before we dive into my outline
              for a business framework using the the EVM let us do the
              following:

              <br />
              <p>
                A Business is a set of contracts, typed, written, or verbal,
                between people with the goal of creating value equivalent to the
                money a free market delegates to it through purchases, renting,
                or investments. Business contracts between people are formed
                around products and funded by purchases of, renting of, or
                speculation on the value of the products they offer;
                specifically, Minimally Viable Products which consumers will
                spend money on to engage with (the service industry), or own
                (the property industry).
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Because the workload of some Minimally Viable Products are more
                than one Employee can deliver on, Organizations of Employees
                form around businesses delivering on more complex products. A
                Minimally Viable Business is a Business which has created a
                Minimally Viable Product.
              </p>

                A business creates an Investor branch by creating a Financial
                Product and offering it to the public (Investors), which in it's
                simplest form is the sale of the of Business itself: the
                businesses monetary value, and the Employee(s) labor contracts.
                Employee(s) offer Financial Products because the Employee(s)
                gain access to future value in the present moment. The
                difference between a Financial Product and a regular Product is
                this: owners of Financial Products are buying portions of a
                Business, where as renters or owners of regular Products are
                buying the end result of a businesses Employee labor.

                What is the Americanization of Business?
              </h4>
              <br />

              <p>
                To be American is to be a participant in a Democratic Republic
                with a system of checks and balances between the Elected
                Representatives of Government where each branch of Elected
                Representatives is subject to the purview of the other branches.
                This has been deemed necessary to protect the Constitutional
                Rights of its Citizens. For the Citizens, their rights are at
                stake when they vote on Representatives.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                If the American Government is necessary to protect rights of the
                Citizen, how is a Business Government necessary within a
                Business Structure?
              </p>
              <br />

              <div class="sub-text">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you don't have an Investor branch the Governmental
                    Structure of a Business is simple: The Business Founder who
                    took all the risk of starting up the business sets the terms
                    of employment and reaps all the reward of it's Employee(s)
                    labor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you have an Investor branch you are sharing the risk
                    and the rewards of Product creation and sale, as well as
                    sharing control over the companies Finances and Employees
                    with the partial owners - Investors. Those Investors have
                    rights which are protected, in America, through a
                    Governmental Structure of a Democratic Republic.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <br />

              <p>
                Having an Americanized Business means to have a board of
                democratically elected representatives from within investors: a
                Board of Directors, run the Business and defend the Rights of
                Business Members (Employees and Investors).
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                So the Americanization of a Business means to offer Business
                Functions to the Public through the sale of a Financial Product,
                and have the Business Members Democratically elect
                Representatives (a Board of Directors) who labor on the
                continued profitability of the Business.

                DAOs are a set of Smart Contracts with functions that execute
                automatically once programmed criteria are met. A DAO has no
                central governing body - hence decetralized autonomy - and whose
                members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the
                entity, usually through proposals to expand or improve upon the
                Smart Contracts that the DAO is comprised of.
